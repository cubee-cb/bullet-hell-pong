## bullet-hell-pong
i came up with this idea after seeing the 3ds homebrew "Pistol Pong", and i thought, "what if more bullets?"
so now i have a whole series of notes about how there's bullet patterns, round win rules, upgrades, arena modifiers, ball behaviours.

i've decided to build it in LOVE2D, cause I want to understand it better and my [past LOVE2D games](https://github.com/cubee-cb/code-samples/tree/main/lua/drone-fight-love2d) were... poorly-coded, to say the least. (well, i was fairly new to gamedev back then... 2018? so fair enough!)
first steps: more than one code file! yay!
